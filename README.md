### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Lisa and I'm a last year's student of the [Cognitive Systems program](https://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/cogsys/ "Link to the University of Potsdam") at the University of Potsdam. That means that I'm specialised in Computational Linguistics, Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. My main expertise lies in Python (numpy, pandas, nltk, scipy, sklearn, tensorflow/keras,...) and I'm looking for a company to collaborate with for my Master's thesis to start at the end of 2020. 

Previously, I've worked on medical data ([prediction of schizophrenia](https://github.com/lisabecker/IM_SchizophreniaPrediction "Link to Github repo") based on semantic jumps in written language output) with Walter Daelemans at the University of Antwerp, worked during [open Summer of code 2020](https://osoc.be/editions/2020 "Link to osoc20") on improving the [search engine experience of the research portal FRIS](https://osoc20.github.io/FRISteam/ "Link to the project") (Flemish government) and recently published my first [paper](https://convention2.allacademic.com/one/aera/aera20/index.php?program_focus=view_paper&selected_paper_id=1577876&cmd=online_program_direct_link&sub_action=online_program "Link to paper") in [text mining in for classification](https://github.com/lisabecker/PM_TextMining_TeacherReportsClassification "Link to Github repo") of self-written reports in order to partially automatise grading processes in educational research and other projects.
