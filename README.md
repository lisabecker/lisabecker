### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Lisa and I'm a last year's student of the [Cognitive Systems program](https://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/cogsys/ "Link to the University of Potsdam") at the University of Potsdam. That means that I'm specialised in Computational Linguistics, Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. My main expertise lies in Python (numpy, pandas, nltk, sklearn, tensorflow/keras,...) and I'm looking for a company to collaborate with for my Master's thesis to start at the end of 2020.
