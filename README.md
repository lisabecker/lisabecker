### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Lisa and I'm a last year's student of the Cognitive System program at University of Potsdam. That means that I'm specialised in Computational Linguistics, Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. My main experience lies with Python (numpy, pandas, nltk, sklearn, tensorflow/keras,...). I'm looking for a company to collaborate with for my Master's thesis to start at the end of 2020.

:bulb: Projects I'm currently working on: 
- writing a review paper on the current state of Natural Language Processing in Reinforcement Learning 
- practicing how to use Tensorflow with Deeplearning.ai's Coursera course
